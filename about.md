I am a scientist, engineer, and physician in training.

I am currently a Staff Engineer at [BD Biosciences](http://www.bdbiosciences.com/). There, I design, implement, and test hardware and softare algorithms for flow cytomtery and cell sorting. Previously, I was a Development Engineer at Omega Biosystems, a flow cytometry startup, where I designed and brought to market a high-speed imaging flow cytometer as part of a 4-person engineering team.

I also serve as a developer at [SimX](http://www.simxar.com), a medical education startup that produces virtual reality tools training tools for healthcare professionals.

I did my Ph.D. studies in the lab of Dino Di Carlo at UCLA where my research focused on developing integrated microfluidic systems for high-throughput measurements of the physical and chemical properties of single cells. My research interests include (inertial) microfluidics, cell mechanics, and machine learning for analysis of high dimensional data.

I earned my B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on signals analysis from Northwestern University. My undergraduate research focused development and characterization of magnetic nanoparticles as diagnostics and therapeutics for cancer and Alzheimer's.

Outside of work, I am particular interested in medical philanthropy especially for traditionally underserved populations. I previously served in the medical leadership of UCLA's Mobile Clinic Project where I coordinated a safety net of clinics serving the homeless and transient populations in the West Los Angeles area. I am also interested in global health and previously served as a leader of the Global Health Selective at UCLA's School of Medicine.

I am currently on leave from the UCLA School of Medicine where I am working towards my M.D.
